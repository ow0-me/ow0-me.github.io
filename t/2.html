"Life has come for me but my eyes are beautiful pools of gorgeous fire and my hair is amazing. I stuck my middle finger up at life and told it to fuck off and it did."</p></div><div class="k31gt"><p>just... try it for a month or two. try saying the most absurdly self-congratulatory shit you can think of. </p></div><div class="k31gt"><p>i know it's tempting to make suicide or self-harm jokes. and for me at least, a decade ago (!) when someone suggested i stop making those kinds of jokes, i was kind of at a loss for what to replace them with. i wanted to make light of these moments, but <em>genuinely</em> (at the time) my first thought <em>really was</em> suicidal ideation. there was a part of me that even felt like ... i was kind of "making light" of that voice. that if i could say <em>i want to die lol</em>, it would help take the sting out of that genuine (albeit passive) desire. like i could turn my illness into a joke.</p></div><div class="k31gt"><p>when i started complimenting myself instead, it felt awkward and stupid. it felt really, <em>really</em> ironic. what i was <em>actually</em> saying was <em>nobody would ever think this stuff about me, that's what makes it so fucking funny.</em></p></div><div class="k31gt"><p>but. the effect was immediate. first thing i noticed was the people around me. when i dropped a glass and said <em>ah my skin is too beautiful and sleek the glass has swooned and broken for me</em>, other people were suddenly overjoyed to jump in with the joke. rather than making an awkward moment, we'd both start cracking up. <em>ah princess sleek hands, i've heard of you</em>. </p></div><div class="k31gt"><p>i was 19. i hadn't noticed i'd been making others tense when i said <em>i want it all to end.</em> i know now that it's <em>incredibly</em> hard to know how to walk that moment - do you talk to them about your concern? do you potentially make them uncomfortable by asking if they're okay? do you ignore the situation? do you help them pick up the glass, or do they need to do it by themselves? are they genuinely made suicidal over this small moment? and most importantly, how do you - without professional training or supplies - actually help?</p></div><div class="k31gt"><p>most people want to help you pick up the glass in your life, they just have no fucking idea how to do it. they don't want to make anything worse. they don't want to make assumptions about you. they love you, they're scared for you - and being scared makes people kind of freeze up. it's not because they don't love you. it's because they <em>do. </em></p></div><div class="k31gt"><p>now when something bad happens, my first thought is <em>how can i make a stupid joke about this.</em> it isn't my brain saying <em>you're a dumb fucking bitch.</em> i spend more time laughing. i spend more time being gentle with myself. i spend more time feeling good. </p></div><div class="k31gt"><p>and the thing is - what's kind of funny - is that you'd be surprised by how many people <em>agree with you.</em> the first time i said <em>i'm too pretty to understand that</em>, someone else said <em>to be fair you're the prettiest person in this room</em>. i promise - you really don't know how kindly your friends see you. but they love you for a reason. they sort of reverse-velveteen-rabbit you. your weird and ugly spots fade away and you just become... the love they want to give you.</p></div><div class="k31gt"><p>go love yourself ironically. the worst thing that happens is that you end up tricking your reflection into <em>actually</em> loving you.</p></div></div></span></div>
<p style="color:Grey;">#something something toxic relationships notwithstanding #(re: the friends stuff) #most people love you. automatically. for being alive. like people are just MADE that way. #and the reason kms jokes don't always land is bc people fucking love you and are like - ahhh how do i help #let them help you!!!!!!</p>
