  <p>TREE(3) Hashish Code [THC] is a team programming competition, organized by TREE(3), for students and professionals around the world. You pick your team and programming language and we pick an engineering problem for you to solve. This year's contest kicks off with a Qualification Round, where your team can compete virtually from wherever you'd like, alongside your Hub. Top teams will then be invited to compete from our virtual World Finals.</p>
